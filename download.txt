To FTP download the file that we UNLOADed (see unload.jcl), use the following from a command prompt (use your own host name, etc):

ftp s0w1.zpdt.local
<userid and password when prompted>
ascii
get EMP.UNLOAD emp.csv
quit

To FTP download the same file, but in MODE B (block mode) so that it can be used with the ZLOAD command, use the following:

ftp s0w1.zpdt.local
<userid and password when prompted>
ascii
quote mode b
get EMP.UNLOAD emp.block.ascii
quit
